# Describe a time when you had to make a decision with incomplete information. What was your approach?

### Short Answer
Faced with making a decision with incomplete information, I relied on a careful assessment of available data, consulted with experienced team members, evaluated potential risks, and made a decision based on calculated assumptions, ensuring flexibility for adjustments.

### Detailed Answer
1. **Situation**:
    - **Urgent Feature Request**: The scenario involved an urgent request to implement a new feature in our software application. The challenge was the lack of complete information about the feature's potential impact on existing system architecture and user experience.

2. **Assessment of Available Information**:
    - **Data Analysis**: I analyzed all available data, including partial specifications of the feature and user feedback on related functionalities.
    - **Historical Precedents**: Reviewed similar past situations and their outcomes for insights.

3. **Consultation with Team and Experts**:
    - **Team Brainstorming**: Conducted a brainstorming session with the team to gather their perspectives based on their experience and expertise.
    - **Expert Opinion**: Consulted with senior developers and architects who had more experience in the domain.

4. **Risk Evaluation**:
    - **Risk Analysis**: Identified potential risks associated with implementing the feature, such as system instability or negative user impact.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Developed strategies to mitigate identified risks.

5. **Decision Based on Calculated Assumptions**:
    - **Informed Assumptions**: Made calculated assumptions based on the gathered information and expert opinions.
    - **Decision Making**: Decided to proceed with a scaled-down version of the feature as a pilot project to assess its impact and gather more data.

6. **Ensuring Flexibility for Adjustments**:
    - **Monitor and Adapt**: Set up a monitoring plan to closely track the featureâ€™s impact and user feedback.
    - **Readiness to Pivot**: Prepared to make quick adjustments or revert changes if the decision showed negative consequences.

### Importance in Work
Making decisions with incomplete information is often necessary in dynamic project environments. It requires a balance of careful analysis, drawing on collective expertise, and readiness to adapt based on new information or feedback.
