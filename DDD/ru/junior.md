**Understanding DDD:**
 - What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and why is it important in software development
 - Explain the basic concepts of a domain, entity, and value object in DDD.

**Ubiquitous Language:**
 - What is the role of a ubiquitous language in DDD
 - How does a ubiquitous language contribute to better communication between development teams and domain experts?

**Aggregates in DDD:**
 - What is an aggregate in DDD, and why is it useful
 - How can you identify and define aggregates in a given domain?

**Bounded Contexts:**
 - Define the concept of a bounded context in DDD
 - Discuss how bounded contexts help manage complexity in large systems.

**Repositories and DDD:**
 - Explain the purpose of repositories in DDD
 - How do repositories facilitate data access within a domain-driven application?

**Value Objects in DDD:**
 - Describe the characteristics of a value object in DDD
 - Provide an example of when you would use a value object instead of an entity.

**Aggregate Roots:**
 - What is the significance of an aggregate root in DDD
 - How do you determine the aggregate root in a given domain?

**Event Sourcing Basics:**
 - What is event sourcing in DDD, and how does it differ from traditional data storage approaches
 - Discuss the benefits and challenges of using event sourcing.

**CQRS in DDD:**
 - Explain the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in the context of DDD
 - How can CQRS improve the scalability of a system?

**Domain Events:**
 - What are domain events, and how are they used in DDD
 - Provide an example of modeling a business process using domain events.

**Service Layer in DDD:**
 - Explain the role of a service layer in Domain-Driven Design
 - When would you introduce a service layer in a domain model?

**Value Object Equality:**
 - How do you implement equality for value objects in DDD
 - Discuss the importance of maintaining value object immutability.

**Decoupling in DDD:**
 - Why is decoupling important in DDD, and how can it be achieved
 - Discuss techniques for reducing dependencies between different parts of a domain model.

**Aggregates and Consistency Boundaries:**
 - What is the consistency boundary of an aggregate
 - Explain how aggregates contribute to maintaining consistency in a domain model.

**UI-Driven Design in DDD:**
 - Discuss the concept of UI-driven design in the context of DDD
 - How can a user interface influence the design of a domain model?

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and DDD:**
 - How does Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) align with DDD practices
 - Discuss the benefits of using BDD for specifying and validating domain behavior.

**Repositories vs. Query Objects:**
 - Differentiate between repositories and query objects in DDD
 - When would you use a repository, and when would you use a query object?

**Context Mapping Strategies:**
 - Explain different strategies for context mapping in DDD
 - Discuss the role of context maps in aligning different bounded contexts.

**Domain Events vs. Integration Events:**
 - Compare and contrast domain events and integration events in DDD
 - When would you choose to use one type of event over the other?

**Handling Concurrency in DDD:**
 - How can you address concurrency issues in a DDD application
 - Discuss optimistic concurrency control and its implications
