# What is an Aggregate in DDD, and how does it differ from regular entities?

### Short Answer
In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), an Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects (entities and value objects) that are treated as a single unit for data changes. It differs from regular entities in that it is designed around a root entity (Aggregate Root) and enforces invariants across the cluster of objects it encompasses.

### Detailed Answer
1. **Aggregate Definition**:
    - **Cluster of Objects**: An Aggregate is a group of related objects (entities and value objects) that are treated as a single unit for the purpose of data changes.
    - **Aggregate Root**: Each Aggregate has a root entity, known as the Aggregate Root, through which all external interactions with the Aggregate occur.

2. **Role of Aggregate Root**:
    - **Single Entry Point**: The Aggregate Root serves as the single entry point for any modifications to the Aggregate. This ensures that all changes are consistent and leave the Aggregate in a valid state.
    - **Guaranteeing Invariants**: The Root is responsible for enforcing all invariants (business rules) within the Aggregate, ensuring the Aggregate's integrity.

3. **Differences from Regular Entities**:
    - **Scope of Invariants**: While regular entities maintain invariants about their own state, Aggregates enforce invariants for a cluster of objects.
    - **Access Control**: Access to the elements within an Aggregate is controlled and channeled through the Aggregate Root, unlike regular entities which may be accessed and modified directly.

4. **Example Scenario**:
    - **E-Commerce Order System**: In an e-commerce system, an `Order` Aggregate includes the `Order` entity as the Aggregate Root, and `LineItem`, `PaymentDetails`, etc., as associated objects. The `Order` Aggregate Root ensures invariants like the total order cost always reflecting the sum of its line items and that payments are processed only if the order is confirmed.

### Importance in Work
Understanding Aggregates in DDD is crucial for ensuring the consistency and integrity of domain models, especially when dealing with complex business rules. It simplifies the model and reduces errors by guaranteeing that all changes to an Aggregate leave it in a valid state.

### Diagram/Table
Aggregate Concept in DDD:

| Aspect           | Aggregate                                      | Regular Entity                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Composition      | Cluster of entities and value objects          | Standalone entity                       |
| Invariant Scope  | Enforces rules across the entire Aggregate     | Enforces rules within the entity itself |
| Access Control   | Through the Aggregate Root only                | Direct access and modification          |
| Example          | `Order` Aggregate with `LineItem`, `PaymentDetails` | An individual `Product` entity         |
