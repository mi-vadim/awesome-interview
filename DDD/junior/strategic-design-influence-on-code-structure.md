# How does Strategic Design affect the way you structure your code?

### Short Answer
Strategic Design in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) significantly influences how code is structured by guiding the organization of the codebase into distinct bounded contexts, aligning it with business capabilities, and ensuring that each context is developed and evolved independently. It promotes a modular and coherent structure that mirrors business complexities.

### Detailed Answer
1. **Modular Codebase Aligned with Bounded Contexts**:
    - **Bounded Contexts as Modules**: Each bounded context in the strategic design translates to a separate module or component in the codebase, encapsulating its specific domain model.
    - **Clear Boundaries**: This separation enforces clear boundaries in the code, leading to a more organized and maintainable structure.

2. **Ubiquitous Language in Code**:
    - **Naming Conventions**: The ubiquitous language developed during strategic design is reflected in the naming conventions of classes, methods, and variables. This ensures that the codebase speaks the same language as the domain experts and business stakeholders.
    - **Improved Readability**: This consistency improves the readability and understandability of the code for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

3. **Context Mapping and Integration**:
    - **Interactions Between Contexts**: The way bounded contexts interact and integrate, as identified in the strategic design, dictates how different modules or services in the codebase communicate with each other.
    - **Integration Mechanisms**: Decisions like using RESTful APIs, message queues, or shared databases for context integration are influenced by the context mapping strategy.

4. **Focus on Core Domain**:
    - **Prioritization in Development**: The core domain identified in the strategic design receives the most attention and effort in the codebase. It's typically where the most sophisticated modeling and complex business logic reside.
    - **Resource Allocation**: More resources and advanced design techniques are allocated to the core domain, while generic subdomains might rely on standard or off-the-shelf solutions.

5. **Evolution and Refactoring**:
    - **Independent Evolution**: Since each bounded context is modular, it can evolve independently based on its own requirements and business drivers, making the codebase more adaptable and easier to refactor.
    - **Focused Refactoring**: Changes in business strategy or insights can lead to refactoring efforts that are contained within specific contexts, reducing the risk of widespread disruption.

### Importance in Work
Strategic Design shapes the code structure in a way that aligns closely with the business needs, making the software more adaptable to changes in business strategy, easier to maintain, and more understandable to both developers and business stakeholders.
