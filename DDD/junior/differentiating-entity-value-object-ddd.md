# What differentiates an Entity from a Value Object in DDD?

### Short Answer
In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), an Entity is an object that is defined by its identity, while a Value Object is defined solely by its attributes. Entities are tracked through changes and have a lifecycle, whereas Value Objects are immutable and interchangeable.

### Detailed Answer
1. **Entity**:
    - **Identity**: Entities are distinguished by a unique identifier. Even if their attributes change over time, they maintain their identity.
    - **Lifecycle and Mutability**: Entities have a lifecycle and can change over time. They are often mutable objects.
    - **Examples**: In a shopping application, an `Order` or a `Customer` would be entities, as each has a distinct identity and can undergo various changes.

2. **Value Object**:
    - **Attribute-based**: Value Objects are defined by their attributes. Two value objects with the same attributes are considered equal.
    - **Immutability**: They are immutable; any change to a Value Object's attributes results in a new Value Object.
    - **No Identity**: They do not have a unique identifier and are not distinguished individually.
    - **Examples**: In the same shopping application, an `Address` or a `Money` object (representing price) would be Value Objects. Their importance lies in what they represent rather than in a distinct identity.

### Importance in Work
Understanding the distinction between Entities and Value Objects in DDD is vital for building a robust domain model. It guides how we treat different objects in the system, how we manage their state and lifecycle, and how we encapsulate business logic, leading to a more intuitive and maintainable codebase.

Comparison of Entity vs. Value Object:

| Aspect           | Entity                                  | Value Object                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition       | Defined by a unique identity             | Defined by its attributes              |
| Mutability       | Mutable, can change over time           | Immutable                              |
| Lifecycle        | Has a lifecycle, tracked through changes| No lifecycle, replaceable              |
| Identity         | Maintains identity even if attributes change | No unique identity, equality based on attributes |
| Example          | `Order`, `Customer` in a shopping app   | `Address`, `Money` in a shopping app   |
