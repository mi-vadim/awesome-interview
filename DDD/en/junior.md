Understanding of DDD Basics:
- What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and why is it relevant in software development?
- Can you explain the concept of a "ubiquitous language" in the context of DDD?
- Define what a "bounded context" is and why it's essential in DDD.

Entity and Value Object Concepts:
- Differentiate between entities and value objects in DDD.
- Provide an example scenario where you would use an entity in a domain model.
- Explain the significance of immutability when dealing with value objects.

Repository Pattern and Aggregates:
- Describe the role of the repository pattern in DDD.
- What is an aggregate, and how does it relate to the concept of consistency boundaries?
- Can you give an example of when using aggregates is beneficial?

Collaborating with Domain Experts:
- How can effective collaboration with domain experts enhance the success of a DDD project?
- Explain the purpose of event storming in the context of DDD.
- How do you ensure that the development team and domain experts share a common understanding of the domain?

Tactical DDD Patterns:
- Define tactical patterns in DDD and provide examples.
- How would you use the concept of aggregates and repositories in tactical DDD patterns?
- Explain how the anti-corruption layer helps maintain consistency between different bounded contexts.

Implementation Challenges:
- Discuss common challenges faced when implementing DDD in a project.
- How do you handle situations where DDD principles seem to conflict with other design paradigms?
- Can you share an example of a scenario where DDD improved the maintainability of a codebase?
