# How do you push and pull images from Docker Hub?

### Short Answer
To push and pull images from Docker Hub, you need to use the `docker push` and `docker pull` commands, respectively. Before pushing an image, you must tag it with the appropriate repository name and log in to Docker Hub. Pulling images can be done anonymously or as a logged-in user, depending on the access level required by the image.

### Full Answer

#### Pushing an Image to Docker Hub

**1. Create an Account and Repository on Docker Hub:**
- Sign up for Docker Hub and create a repository where you'll push your image.

**2. Log in to Docker Hub from the Command Line:**
- Execute `docker login` and enter your Docker Hub username and password.

**3. Tag Your Image:**
- Before pushing, tag your local image with the repository name using `docker tag`.
- Syntax: `docker tag local-image:tagname yourhubusername/reponame:tag`
- Example: If you have an image named `myapp` with tag `latest`, and your Docker Hub username is `johndoe`, you'd run: `docker tag myapp:latest johndoe/myapp:latest`

**4. Push the Image:**
- Now, push the image to Docker Hub using the `docker push` command.
- Syntax: `docker push yourhubusername/reponame:tag`
- Continuing the example: `docker push johndoe/myapp:latest`

#### Pulling an Image from Docker Hub

**1. Find the Image on Docker Hub:**
- Identify the image you want to pull from Docker Hub. You can search on the Docker Hub website or use the `docker search` command.

**2. Pull the Image:**
- Use the `docker pull` command to download the image from Docker Hub to your local machine.
- Syntax: `docker pull reponame:tag`
- Example: To pull the latest official nginx image, you would use: `docker pull nginx:latest`

**3. Verify the Image is Pulled:**
- Use the `docker images` command to see the list of images on your local machine, including the one you just pulled.
