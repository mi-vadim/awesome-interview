# What is a Dockerfile and what are its basic components?

### Short Answer
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Its basic components include instructions like `FROM` to specify the base image, `RUN` to run commands, `CMD` to provide defaults for an executing container, `EXPOSE` to expose ports, `ENV` to set environment variables, and `COPY` or `ADD` to add files from the host to the container.

### Full Answer
A Dockerfile is essentially a script composed of various commands and arguments listed successively to automatically perform actions on a base image in order to create a new one. Here are some of the basic components that can be used in a Dockerfile:

1. **FROM**: This is the first command in most Dockerfiles. It defines the base image to use to start the build process. It can be any image, including the ones derived from other base images. For example, `FROM ubuntu:18.04` starts the build using the Ubuntu 18.04 image.

2. **RUN**: This command is used to execute a command line within the container, which creates a new layer on top of the existing image and commits the results. For example, `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-bar` would install a package in an Ubuntu base image.

3. **CMD**: The CMD instruction provides defaults for an executing container. These defaults can include an executable or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well. If Docker container runs with parameters, the CMD parameters are overridden. Typically, CMD is used to run the software contained by your image, along with any arguments.

4. **LABEL**: This is used to add metadata to an image, such as the maintainer's name, email, etc. For example, `LABEL maintainer="name@email.com"`.

5. **EXPOSE**: This instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

6. **ENV**: The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key>=<value>, which will be used in subsequent instructions and can be overwritten using runtime parameters.

7. **ADD** and **COPY**: Both instructions are used to copy new files, directories, or remote file URLs from <src> and add them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>. `COPY` is preferred when you're only copying from your build context, while `ADD` has some additional features like tar extraction and remote URL support.

8. **ENTRYPOINT**: This command allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. Command line arguments to docker run `<img>` will be appended after all elements in an exec form ENTRYPOINT, and will override all elements specified using CMD.

9. **WORKDIR**: This sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.

10. **VOLUME**: This creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from the native host or other containers.

### Importance to Business
Understanding and effectively utilizing Dockerfiles is vital for businesses as it provides a way to automate the deployment and configuration of applications, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Dockerfiles ensure that the environments are reproducible, scalable, and controlled, which minimizes the variability between environments and reduces errors in production. This leads to faster development cycles, quicker deployment times, and more robust, reliable applications, all contributing to business agility and competitive performance.

### Importance to Developer
For developers, Dockerfiles are crucial as they provide a method to document and automate the process of image creation. This reduces manual setup, increases the reproducibility of the builds, and ensures consistency across multiple development, testing, and production environments. This means less time debugging environment-specific issues and more time focusing on developing new features and improving existing ones.

|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FROM**   | Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.                  |
| **RUN**    | Runs a command in the container.                                  |
| **CMD**    | Provides defaults for executing container.                        |
| **LABEL**  | Adds metadata to an image.                                        |
| **EXPOSE** | Informs Docker that the container listens on specified ports.     |
| **ENV**    | Sets environment variable.                                        |
| **ADD/COPY**| Copies new files or directories into Docker image.                |
| **ENTRYPOINT** | Configures a container that will run as an executable.         |
| **WORKDIR** | Sets the working directory.                                       |
| **VOLUME** | Creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers. |
