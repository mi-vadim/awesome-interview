# Create a small script that uses the Docker API to start and stop containers.

Understood. Let's restructure the response to include a Makefile for a script that uses the Docker API to start and stop containers. The Makefile will define tasks to run a Python script performing the Docker API interactions.

### Makefile Approach for Docker API Script

**File Structure:**

- `DockerApiScript.py`: Python script that interacts with the Docker API.
- `Makefile`: Defines tasks to run the script.

### DockerApiScript.py

Here's the Python script:

```python
import requests_unixsocket

session = requests_unixsocket.Session()
base_url = "http+unix://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock"

def list_containers():
    response = session.get(f"{base_url}/containers/json")
    return response.json()

def control_container(container_id, action):
    response = session.post(f"{base_url}/containers/{container_id}/{action}")
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print(f"{action.capitalize()}ed container: {container_id}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to {action} container: {response.text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    containers = list_containers()
    if containers:
        container_id = containers[0]["Id"]
        control_container(container_id, 'start')
        # Insert additional container interaction logic here
        control_container(container_id, 'stop')
```

### Makefile

And here's the Makefile to run the Python script:

```makefile
.PHONY: start-containers stop-containers list-containers

list-containers:
	python DockerApiScript.py list

start-containers:
	python DockerApiScript.py start

stop-containers:
	python DockerApiScript.py stop
```

### Instructions:

1. **Running the Make Commands:**
    - To list containers: `make list-containers`
    - To start the first container: `make start-containers`
    - To stop the first container: `make stop-containers`

2. **Setting Up:**
    - Ensure Docker is running on your system.
    - Install Python and necessary libraries (`requests` and `requests-unixsocket`).
    - Run the Make commands as per your requirement.

### Importance to Business & Developers:

- **Business**: Streamlining container management through scripting and automation improves operational efficiency and reduces the risk of manual errors.
- **Developers**: Provides a simple and reproducible method to interact with Docker for development, testing, and operations tasks, enhancing productivity and focus.

By using a Makefile in conjunction with a Python script, you can effectively organize and streamline the process of starting and stopping Docker containers using the Docker API, making it a more manageable and error-free operation suitable for both development and production environments.
