Architecting a high-availability (HA) storage solution for a stateful application requires ensuring data persistence, resilience to failures, and seamless access to data across a distributed system. This example will leverage a combination of Docker volumes, replication, and a network file system (NFS) to create a robust HA storage solution.

### Overview

The architecture will consist of:
- **Stateful Application Containers**: Containers that run your application, requiring persistent and shared access to data.
- **Docker Volumes with NFS**: Docker volumes will be used for data storage, with NFS serving as the underlying storage backend to provide shared access and data persistence.
- **Volume Replication**: Implementing replication across multiple NFS servers to ensure data availability and redundancy.
- **Load Balancers**: To distribute requests across application instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

### Components

1. **Stateful Application Containers**: These containers host the application requiring persistent storage. They are orchestrated to ensure that they can be scaled and managed efficiently.

2. **Docker Volumes**: Managed through Docker, these volumes are created as part of the container deployment process. By using a plugin or driver that supports NFS, these volumes will be mapped to an NFS share, ensuring that data is written to a centralized location accessible by all application instances.

3. **NFS Server**: Acts as the central storage system. For high availability, at least two NFS servers would be configured in an active-passive or active-active cluster, depending on the specific requirements and capabilities of the NFS solution in use.

4. **Replication Mechanism**: To ensure data is replicated across NFS servers, a replication mechanism is set up. This can be achieved through software solutions that synchronize data between NFS servers, ensuring that a copy of the data is always available even if one server fails.

5. **Load Balancers**: Placed in front of both the application containers and NFS servers (if in an active-active configuration), to distribute incoming traffic and storage requests across available nodes, enhancing the system's overall availability and resilience to failures.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up NFS Servers**: Configure NFS servers with shared storage. If using an active-passive setup, ensure that the passive server can take over seamlessly in case of a failure.

2. **Configure Replication**: Set up a replication mechanism between NFS servers. This could be continuous or scheduled, depending on the criticality of the data and performance considerations.

3. **Deploy Docker Volumes**: When deploying your containers, specify the NFS-backed Docker volumes for data storage, ensuring all containers access the same NFS share for their persistent storage needs.

4. **Implement Load Balancers**: Deploy load balancers to manage traffic to your application containers, ensuring requests are evenly distributed and that the system can handle the failure of one or more containers.

5. **Monitoring and Failover Handling**: Implement monitoring tools to keep track of the health of your NFS servers and application containers. Automate failover procedures to reduce downtime in case of server failures.

### Considerations

- **Data Consistency**: Ensure the replication mechanism maintains data consistency across NFS servers. This may involve choosing the right replication strategy and tools.
- **Performance**: Monitor performance closely, as NFS and replication can introduce latency. Optimize network configurations and NFS settings for performance.
- **Scalability**: Plan for future scalability by choosing solutions that can easily scale out, such as adding more NFS servers or containers as needed.
- **Security**: Implement security measures for both NFS and Docker, including network security, access controls, and encryption as necessary to protect sensitive data.

This high-availability storage solution provides a robust foundation for stateful applications, ensuring data persistence, scalability, and resilience against failures, thereby supporting the application's availability and reliability requirements.
