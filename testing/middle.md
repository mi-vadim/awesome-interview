**Advanced TDD**
 - Technical: What are the advantages of using a more advanced TDD approach like BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)?
 - Practical: How would you implement BDD in a mid-sized project?

**Test Doubles**
 - Technical: Explain the different types of test doubles and their purposes.
 - Practical: Provide a scenario where a spy would be more appropriate than a mock.

**Test Isolation**
 - Technical: Why is test isolation important, and how is it achieved?
 - Practical: Describe a situation where lack of test isolation caused issues in the testing process.

**Performance Testing in Integration**
 - Technical: How is performance testing integrated into integration tests?
 - Practical: Describe a method to benchmark performance within an integration test.

**Dependency Injection for Testing**
 - Technical: Explain how dependency injection can facilitate more effective testing.
 - Practical: Give an example of using dependency injection in a unit test.

**Advanced Mocking Techniques**
 - Technical: Discuss the use of advanced mocking techniques like partials or dynamic mocks.
 - Practical: How would you mock a static method in a class?

**Test Prioritization**
 - Technical: What factors influence the prioritization of test cases?
 - Practical: How do you decide which tests to run first in a continuous integration pipeline?

**Flaky Tests**
 - Technical: What are flaky tests, and why are they problematic?
 - Practical: What strategies can you use to deal with flaky tests?

**Test Data Management**
 - Technical: Discuss the challenges of managing test data.
 - Practical: How would you implement a strategy for maintaining consistent test data?

**Security Testing in Integration**
 - Technical: How is security testing integrated into integration tests?
 - Practical: Describe a situation where you had to ensure that integration tests covered security concerns.
